## Quotes

> "Rather than beginning with shiny new techology, we start by trying to establish deep, personal empathy with our users to determine their needs and wants. We must fill in two blanks: Our users need a better way to ? BECAUSE ?. The because portion is a big deal." - **Dr. James Patell**

---
> Users don't hate change. Users hate change that doesn't make their life better, but make them have to relearn everything they knew. In fact, users don't like change that might improve their lives if they don't perceive the value of that change. - [Users don't hate change. They hate you.](https://medium.com/design-startups/461772fbcac7)

---
> Experiments are needed for creation.

---
> Design tons of stuff and throw tons of it away. The faster you design crap, the closer you're going to get to designing something amazing.

---
> When I was a young designer, I would design something and think, 'Oh, this is amazing,' but then when I looked at it the next day I'd be like, 'What the hell was I thinking? This is terrible.' So now I design something and then put it to bed and look at it the next day. Sleeping on it is important.

> It's true, nothing lasts. But no matter. That's the nature of the design work we do. - [Marcos Weskamp's Flipboard](http://www.fastcompany.com/3017867/most-creative-people/how-flipboards-head-designer-grapples-with-the-webs-manic-pace-of-chang)

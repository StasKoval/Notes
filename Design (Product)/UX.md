## Quotes

> "Rather than beginning with shiny new techology, we start by trying to establish deep, personal empathy with our users to determine their needs and wants. We must fill in two blanks: Our users need a better way to ? BECAUSE ?. The because portion is a big deal." - **Dr. James Patell**

---
> Users don't hate change. Users hate change that doesn't make their life better, but make them have to relearn everything they knew. In fact, users don't like change that might improve their lives if they don't perceive the value of that change. - [Users don't hate change. They hate you.](https://medium.com/design-startups/461772fbcac7)

---
> Experiments are needed for creation.

---
> Design tons of stuff and throw tons of it away. The faster you design crap, the closer you're going to get to designing something amazing.

---
> When I was a young designer, I would design something and think, 'Oh, this is amazing,' but then when I looked at it the next day I'd be like, 'What the hell was I thinking? This is terrible.' So now I design something and then put it to bed and look at it the next day. Sleeping on it is important.

---
> It's true, nothing lasts. But no matter. That's the nature of the design work we do. - [Marcos Weskamp's Flipboard](http://www.fastcompany.com/3017867/most-creative-people/how-flipboards-head-designer-grapples-with-the-webs-manic-pace-of-chang)

---
> Just executing - making things that actually live out the strategy and giving the higher ups a better choice to make. Make it and then iterate. "Show, don't tell". It's not enough to know the right answers, the real design challenge is in getting the organisation to adopt and implement and maintain good design. - [Design is the easy part...](http://www.disambiguity.com/design-is-the-easy-part/)

---
> Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design - Dieter Rams

---
> But slowly, like ocean tides whittling away a rocky cliff, these additions add up until one day, your users see your site as cluttered. Then, some other app will come along that seems fresh and simple and tackles the same problem as your app. And at that point, it is already too late. - [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/6c975dede146)

---
> But it's magic when the software generates a disproportionately meaningful output from that minimised input. - Khoi Vinh

---
> If customers say they want faster horses, what you should hear is that getting around is too slow. It's the team's job to take all that raw input and build products to delight customers.

1. Great products are **understandable** (set expectations and live up to them), **meaningful** and **delightful**.
2. Reimagine your product spec as a press release (Amazon release X product that helps Y people do Z thing). It requires you to think of the end, the benefit to a person. What is exciting or promotable about this idea?
3. Design flows, not screens. When users complete a task, make sure there are pathways for them to continue down (discover new things, find friends, etc.)
4. Reward users with success from the earliest possible interaction.
5. It is the cumulative effect of lots of little improvements that create successful products.
6. Share ideas early and often, your design don't need to be saved for a big reveal.
7. Don't forget to prepare the communication for new features (product marketing, support, etc.)
8. Small repetitive cycles of design-test-release-evaluate drives greater team and customer satisfaction and help team learn and improve faster.
9. The product is always a WIP. Never get too attached to any particular element because it will change.
10. Change makes people uncomfortable. A designer's job is to help people experience change as comfortably as possible.
11. Have a preference towards faster and sooner.

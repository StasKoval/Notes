1. **Good design is simple.** When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
2. **Good design is timeless.** If something is ugly, it can't be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it. If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
3. **Good design solves the right problem.**
4. **Good design is suggestive.** It does not impose, but suggest.
5. **Good design is often slightly funny.** Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called humourless also being good design.
6. **Good design looks easy.** Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.
7. **Good design uses symmetry.**
8. **Good design resembles nature.**
9. **Good design is redesign.** It's rare to get things right the first time. You should cultivate dissatisfaction.
10. **Good design can copy.** If part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, there's no reason not to use it.
11. **Good design happens in chunks.**
12. **Good design is often daring.** Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.

1. Some designers will come up with an idea, and maybe at first it will seem a little strange. If there was some top-down review process, it wouldn't survive. But then it will turn out that it's a huge win with users.

1. **Good design is simple.** When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
2. **Good design is timeless.** If something is ugly, it can't be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it. If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
3. **Good design solves the right problem.**
4. **Good design is suggestive.** It does not impose, but suggest.
5. **Good design is often slightly funny.** Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called humourless also being good design.
6. **Good design looks easy.** Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.
7. **Good design uses symmetry.**
8. **Good design resembles nature.**
9. **Good design is redesign.** It's rare to get things right the first time. You should cultivate dissatisfaction.
10. **Good design can copy.** If part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, there's no reason not to use it.
11. **Good design happens in chunks.**
12. **Good design is often daring.** Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.
13. [Don't give your users shit work - Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/)
14. Let's talk about making tools. The things we make should either reduce pain, increase pleasure, or do some mix of the two - [No New Tools](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/)
15. Good design is motivated by use cases, workflows.
16. Good design is built from small, orthogonal, and com posable primitives.
17. [Designing is editing](http://blog.simplease.at/2014/05/designing-is-editing/)
18. **Good design is about taking things apart.** Module, components, etc.
19. Simplicity is actual work.
20. Understanding, not simplicity
21. Complex, but understandable
22. Complicated == Confusing
23. Complex == Life!
24. If it is too simple, it is dull, boring. If it is too complex, it is confusing. We like intermediate which is a moving target! Expert mode, see game designer.
25. Design is Social Science, Art, Technology and Engineering.

1. Some designers will come up with an idea, and maybe at first it will seem a little strange. If there was some top-down review process, it wouldn't survive. But then it will turn out that it's a huge win with users.

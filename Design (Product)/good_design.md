1. **Good design is simple.** When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
2. **Good design is timeless.** If something is ugly, it can't be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it. If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
3. **Good design solves the right problem.**
4. **Good design is suggestive.** It does not impose, but suggest.
5. **Good design is often slightly funny.** Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called humourless also being good design.
6. **Good design looks easy.** Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.
7. **Good design uses symmetry.**
8. **Good design resembles nature.**
9. **Good design is redesign.** It's rare to get things right the first time. You should cultivate dissatisfaction.
10. **Good design can copy.** If part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, there's no reason not to use it.
11. **Good design happens in chunks.**
12. **Good design is often daring.** Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.
13. [Don't give your users shit work - Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/)
14. Let's talk about making tools. The things we make should either reduce pain, increase pleasure, or do some mix of the two - [No New Tools](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/)
15. Good design is motivated by use cases, workflows.
16. Good design is built from small, orthogonal, and com posable primitives.
17. [Designing is editing](http://blog.simplease.at/2014/05/designing-is-editing/)
18. **Good design is about taking things apart.** Module, components, etc.
19. Simplicity is actual work.
20. Understanding, not simplicity
21. Complex, but understandable
22. Complicated == Confusing
23. Complex == Life!
24. If it is too simple, it is dull, boring. If it is too complex, it is confusing. We like intermediate which is a moving target! Expert mode, see game designer.
25. Design is Social Science, Art, Technology and Engineering.
26. The idea of a design driven company is that design is for the entire company, not just designers but for engineers also. Cautioned the overuse of the term "design driven" so as not to exclude other key players necessary to build a user-centered product and successful company.
27. Making something helps remove the rust.
28. Design is rendering intention. Design is about intention. We can choose to imitate or innovate.
29. Experiences can be designed. It is within our control.
30. Making something look simple is easy; making something simple to use is much harder.
31. One cannot not communicate. Therefore there is no such thing as a neutral design. Everything has a voice.

1. Some designers will come up with an idea, and maybe at first it will seem a little strange. If there was some top-down review process, it wouldn't survive. But then it will turn out that it's a huge win with users.

> "In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service." - Steve Jobs

> My advice is to make things that are truly great. Don't make things that are great at earning money, winning users, pleasing investors, or satisfying your ego. Make things that are great at doing the task they are intended to do.

> This is where creating products becomes art. If you are making the product good just for the sake of it being good, then it's art. The great thing is, it usually ends up satisfying the other business-related goals even better than if you had optimized for them specifically. I consider this mentality a life decision, not a business decision.

> The more you fail, the more you succeed. The longer you wait to fail, the fewer successes you'll have. My biggest failure is not failing fast enough when I knew time was already up. My advice to anyone trying anything, fail, then try again.

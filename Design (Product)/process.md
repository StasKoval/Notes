> The obvious problem here is the lack of any design in the first place. Going from the idea directly to implementation with minimum effort on design usually proves to be a very bad idea.

> Util actual users use it, everybody is working with assumptions (some might just have more accurate assumptions than others).

> An MVP should be fast and easy to put through a reality check. If you have the team capable of delivering this in 3 days, why do more?

> If you think that it's impossible to test your idea in 3 days, you are wrong. Because what you need is not a fully functional prototype, but simply a proof that your idea will drive some interest, which is something that can be achieved with a fraction of what you think your product should do.

> Jony's team apparently documents everything they do through sketching. In that sense, I think writing is particularly useful to design. I don't like to write about generic guidelines, but I do love to write about ideas, design processes and inspirations. It deepens the craft. - Meng To

> Action expresses priorities 

* Over-communicate
* [Failing is not only okay, it becomes the acceleration of your design process](http://blog.simplease.at/2014/05/designing-is-editing/)

3 key themes:

* Designing systems
* Designing uniquely personalised experiences
* **Designing for change**

Something to break the ICE:

* The McDonald's suggestion. "How about McDonalds?" to break the ice and kick off ideas flowing in.
* If you have a magic wand, what will you do? Pretend you have infinite resources and time, how would we do this?
* Stay in sketch mode, much longer than you think. Longer than you're probably used to. As soon as you go into Photoshop you're slowing yourself down and walling yourself off. In the beginning of the process, when **alignment** and problem solving are paramount, you need to stay in sketch mode as long as possible.
* Tons of artboards and layers, but no clear story or point of view. No pitch.

## Mech's Process

* Collect phase (Diverge) - Don't evaluate, just collect. Don't edit. Use "echo technique" to talk back and reaffirm with stakeholder. Moderate, don't edit. Take pictures. Share result.
* Converge (Coalesce) - Narrow down and evaluate.
* Workshop - you present by testing. Show stakeholders what you've learned. Get them to "echo" back to you. Invite them to amend.
* Don't try to define *objects*. Think in association and relation instead. Actions are cheap, vocabulary is expensive.
* Iterate until DONE. Not 100%. Close enough is close enough. Don't get caught in an endless loop.

1. Know your personas
2. Measure and iterate
3. Scale out (more machines) is better
4. Share as soon as possible
5. Always announce your deadline. Create time pressure.
6. Insights from the whole team
7. No group brainstorming. Own individual sketch, then compete and pick/vote.
8. Not need to "Ship early, ship often". But "Learn early, learn often". Rent before you buy.
9. Design matters. Speed matters.
10. Win or learn. There is no loser in a design sprint.
11. Solving the right problem first.
12. Make great things. Fast.

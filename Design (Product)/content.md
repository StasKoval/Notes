Purpose of layouts:

1. **Sequential Order**. What user want to do first, and next. Business goals.
2. **Visual Hierarchy**. Guide the eye. Size, color, spacing, etc.
3. **Associative Connection**. What goes with what?

In the direct access world of the Web, it's the content itself (and not the gateway to that content) that often matters most.

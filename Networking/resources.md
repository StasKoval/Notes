## Switch

Smarter than Hub. Switch is a directory of MAC addresses.
A fresh switch do not have the correct directory. So all nodes will tell the switch their MAC address to help it populate the directory.

Layer 2 (Data Link layer) address is MAC address.


## Router

Router is a directory of IP addresses.

Layer 3 (Network layer)

Logical LAN which contain it's own broadcast domain.
Must be in the same subnet.

You need a layer 3 device to communicate between VLANs.

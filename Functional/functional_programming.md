# Functional Programming (FP)

> The whole OOP paradigm is based on sending messages to objects as the only means to interact with their state, therefore making state distributed.

We're still stuck with mostly "von Neumann" style languages that talk about state and assignment and memory and stuff.

## Programming Paradigms - Styles

* Unstructured - Assembly languages, linear sequence of instructions interrupted with occasional jump.
* Structured - ALGOL, Pascal, Ada. Procedural and OOP can consider as structured programming.
* Procedural - Derived from Structured Programming, based on routines, subroutines, or functions. A "von Neumann" style of programming where memory location and loading of instructions is very common. Procedural code can have side-effect as it can store state between calls.
* Functional
* Object Oriented
* Data-flow
* Query

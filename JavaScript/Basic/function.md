# Function

* [The `bind` operator](https://medium.com/@matthewwithanm/api-design-the-bind-operator-5a22d255bb18)

Executing a function is called *invoking*, *calling*, or *applying* it.

## Higher-Order Functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. They allow us to abstract over *actions*, not just values.

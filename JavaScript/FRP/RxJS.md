# RxJS

We have many PUSH APIs:

* DOM
* Websockets
* Node Streams
* Service Workers
* Server-Sent Events
* XHR
* setInterval

Each has their own way of dealing with asynchronous data like:

* Callback functions - callback hell, poor concurrency
* Promises - only ever yield a single value, not good for recurring events
* Event emitters

## Observables

Observable is a datatype by Reactive Extensions (Rx). It abstracts away the concept of a data source that represent a stream of events. We treat mouse, click, network events as a "database" that we can query from.

It is being proposed for ES7. What does observable represents? It is a collection over time. Essentially, it is stream of events.

RxJS is push-based, so the source of events (Observable) will push new values to the consumer (Observer), without the consumer needing to request the next value.

```js
// Observable always start from a place, a source if you will, to get data from.
// In this case, the data is just a simple click event generated by the user.
var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, 'click');

// Filter out clicks that happen on the right side of the screen and logs only the first 10 clicks
Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click')
  .filter(c => c.clientX > window.innerWidth / 2)
  .take(10)
  .subscribeOnNext(c => console.log(c.clientX, c.clientY));
```

We are subscribed to sequences, not only to discrete values.

Observables don't do anything until at least one Observer subscribes to them.

> Observable is not a replacement for Enumerable. I would not recommend trying to take something that is naturally pull-based and force it to be push-based.

## Operators

* [Docs for Operators](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/api/core/operators)

In RxJS, methods that transform (map) or query sequences are called operators.

`create` and `fromEvent` are all creation operators. They create Observables for common sources.

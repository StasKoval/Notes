### Workflow Ideas

* Show consultant companies they have been working on recently at the dashboard.
* Track the JD they have been working on automatically. Ordered by last touch or most touched (meaning the JD they work on frequently).
* To be effective and flexibly, make thing temporal and don't build a structure on it. Life is messy remember?

### UI Ideas

* Make use of pop-up like PaintCode interface and Basecamp's Calendar.

## Problem

In light of ever razor-thin profit margins, how can we perform thing faster to get ahead of out competitors?

## Content Model

Tags are too freeform and unreliable. They are too independent and does not work well as a system. Instead, lets use taxonomies and categories to construct our content structure. It will be more reliable for building automatic system.

Categories must not be 3 level deep. The Inception Rule.

### Workflow Ideas

* Show consultant companies they have been working on recently at the dashboard.
* Track the JD they have been working on automatically. Ordered by last touch or most touched (meaning the JD they work on frequently).
* To be effective and flexibly, make thing temporal and don't build a structure on it. Life is messy remember?
* Merge tags and auto-tagging?

### UI Ideas

* Make use of pop-up like PaintCode interface and Basecamp's Calendar.

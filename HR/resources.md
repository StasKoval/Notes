## Problem

In light of ever razor-thin profit margins, how can we perform thing faster to get ahead of out competitors?

## Content Model

Tags are too freeform and unreliable. They are too independent and does not work well as a system. Instead, lets use taxonomies and categories to construct our content structure. It will be more reliable for building automatic system.

Categories must not be 3 level deep. The Inception Rule.

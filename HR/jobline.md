# Jobline's Problem

* The dashboard of CL is not very helpful in their day to day tasks, especially when it comes to month's end where they need to approve timesheets, leaves, etc. The level of audit and tracking is lacking also, such as who approve what, and when.
* CL really is confuse with the arrangement of what tasks they should do "right now", and how to keep track of what they have done.
* There is no way to know when Timesheet is being approved. Right now, I am using PostMark to see when email was sent to client to ask them to approved to determine Timesheet's submission date time.
* Creating timesheet is not idiot-proof. People can create Jan timesheet when it was Dec now! We must at least alert CA that Jan is not the correct month!

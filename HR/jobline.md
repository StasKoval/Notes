# Jobline's Problem

There's a lot of challenges in crafting new experiences and workflows to meet contemporary HR demands.

* The dashboard of CL is not very helpful in their day to day tasks, especially when it comes to month's end where they need to approve timesheets, leaves, etc. The level of audit and tracking is lacking also, such as who approve what, and when.
* CL really is confuse with the arrangement of what tasks they should do "right now", and how to keep track of what they have done.
* There is no way to know when Timesheet is being approved. Right now, I am using PostMark to see when email was sent to client to ask them to approved to determine Timesheet's submission date time.
* Creating timesheet is not idiot-proof. People can create Jan timesheet when it was Dec now! We must at least alert CA that Jan is not the correct month!
* Design staff on-boarding materials, like where to eat, etc.

* Use [Moo.com](http://uk.moo.com/design-templates/luxe/business-cards/) for business card

* Payslip - No date range select for like last 3 months payslip which is likely useful for many application requests.
* Import company members with update/merge. See Xero's CSV import example.
* Issues navigator - See Xcode 6 issues implementation. We can intelligently supply noted issues to recruiters.
* Make real-time per-event decision. See http://voltdb.com/welcome-1
* Make use of lots of popover for quick action
* Use Amazon SES for email blasting - See http://beta.emailoctopus.com/ also
* "Ready&Smile" - A slogan for interview

* Company profile is crucial to attracting talents. We do not have a nice company profile that is compelling enough for CA to view.
* Company Ethos
* Some job categories are obsolete like "IT & Telecommunication"
* Let staff view their own job handling
* Scoreboards, leaderboards, let consultants see how they ranked among the entire community and adjust their strategy and velocity.
* SOA - some has partial payment and we can see the `amt_os` to know what is left for outstanding. I think only `nett_payable_w_gst` need to change to reflect the same as `amt_os` while `amt_payable_w_gst` remains.
* Display a "poo" besides those pipeline stages where it is long and smelly
* Scheduling interview - Missing CA at DB!
* Should we email CA when they

## Account Management

* Invitation (invite collaborator, co-worker, etc. See Dropbox example - https://www.dropbox.com/guide/business/highlights/getting-started)
* Transfer Ownership
* See Amazon AWS's IAM policy like Allow, Deny as example. Groups.
* Users, Groups, Roles, Permissions, Sharing, Conditions

Use Group to manage Permission. Don't manage it at User-level.
Map permissions to a specific business function.

* Should we email CA when they are CV profiled - Eveleen
* Schedule Interview - What happen if the CA is not in our DB? Should we import them even if they don't have SRID with us.

# RWD Process

* Fluid Grid
* Flexible Images
* Media Queries

The Web is Flexible and *Fragile*. We can constraint it as much as we like with fixed-width layout and type in pixels, but the Web will shrug off whatever constraints we place around it.

**To ensure our layouts aren't just responsive, but sustainable - fit to deliver compelling content and rich interfaces**

Let go of your need to control the width and height of your layouts. design for a universal, device-agnostic web. Embrace unpredictability.

> Meet our users wherever they happen to be.

Start with markup that is valid, accessible, and functional on almost any device, and layer enhancements from there.

## Content

* [Content patterns and Display patterns](http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/)

Clean up and prioritize content.

> We think about how to present a design's content and features across a range of screen sizes and devices.
>
> Do the interface components yield to the content when screen real estate is tight? Are the content and hierarchy easy to parse? Do the line lengths foster readability?

Don't hide content. If it's useful to some people, it's likely useful to everyone. Users want and need the same information on all devices.

> Flabby old content can't be shoved into stretchy new responsive clothes, so your editorial process and workflow must evolve.

### Adaptive Content

Adaptive content is stored as smaller, presentation-independent chunks.

## Breakpoints

> Move into the browser quickly. Deciding in the browser.

While it's tempting to choose breakpoints early in the design process, **the truth is that we shouldn't choose breakpoints at all**.

Instead, we should find them, using our content as a guide.

Start with the small screen first, then expand until it looks like shit. Time for a breakpoint! Or choose a comfortable "measure" (45-75 characters).

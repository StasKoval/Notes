* 1st Wave - AI, Pattern Recognition (50's - 70's)
* 2nd Wave - Neural Network (Credit card scoring), Data Mining (80's - 90's)
* 3rd Wave - Machine Learning, Convergence (Mid 90's - Today)
* 4th Wave - Big Data

Machine learning is roughly about 2 things:

* Prediction
* Discovery

Signal in the data is very subtle.

Storytelling give memory, memory shape behavior. Story is what change people's behavior.

Fuel Band - People don't like number, it's time to translate into something else.

Treat *machine learning deployment* as you would software like using continuous deployment, RESTful API, language bindings, security and SLA.

## Data Structure

Raw Data -- Data Structure -- Algorithm -- Insight

* Flat table. User-item interaction log, SysLog, row and column, hash, etc.
* Graph. Edge List, Vertex List

## Why predict?

* To prevent bad outcome
* Recommendations for cross-selling
* Targeted marketing

## Statistic

* [Power law distribution](http://data.heapanalytics.com/your-average-revenue-per-customer-is-meaningless/)

## People

* Alexander Gray - Skytree

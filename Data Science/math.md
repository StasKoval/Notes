* **Decomposition** - decompose a task into details so we can explain the process to another person/computer
* **Pattern Recognition** - Notice similarity and differences
* **Pattern Generalization and Abstraction** - Make use of abstraction to understand and solve problems
* **Algorithm Design** - Develop step by step strategy for solving a problem


## Linear Equation

```
y = mx + b

m = slope
b = intercept
```

## Polynomial

A way to describe more complex curve, not just straight line.

```
3x + 4y = 1

x and y = terms
3 and 4 = coefficients

X2 - 5x + 6 = 0

1, -5, 6 = coefficients
```

## Matrix

2D array of numbers, much like table or a spreadsheet.

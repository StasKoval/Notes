# Statistic

Statistic can tell and do not tell us. Be careful.

Statistic is all about "thinking in data", statistic merely aid in that process.

1. Establish or adopt a system of assigning values, most often numbers (but can be other category or mode), to the object or concepts that are central to the problem under study.
2. Study the categories captured and their nuances and determine how little or detailed you want it to be.
3. Take measurement
4. Study the objects and their relationships

Some measurements are abstract like psychometrics qualities. Establishing that a particular measurement is meaningful is more difficult when it can't be observed directly.

4 levels of measurement:

1. Nominal data - name, label, categorical data
2. Ordinal data - data that has meaningful order like size: small, medium, large
3. Interval data - temperature, divide a full range of order sizes into a series of sequential, equally sized intervals
4. Ratio data - height, weight, age, income, measures of change

Any variable based on counting is discrete.

"Quality of hire" is an operationalization of an abstract concept. Hard to measure, but not impossible. We can interview or send out survey for hiring manager to fill in and rate the quality of hire. Proxy measurement?

Triangulation measurement for applicants. Combining information from multiple sources. See Multitrait, Multimethod Matrix (MTMM)

The sample needs to be a good representation of the study population.

## Summary - Aggregation

4 averages:

1. Mean - SUM/COUNT, isn't always the best choice for your story because mean is very sensitive to extremes (outliers).
2. Median - 50th percentile. Sort values in order and find value that falls in the middle of the set.
3. Mode
4. Midrange

## Storyboard

* [Storyboard vs NIB vs Custom code](http://www.toptal.com/ios/ios-user-interfaces-storyboards-vs-nibs-vs-custom-code)

You can combine storyboards with nibs (Interface Builder).

The `UIApplication` will load the `Main.storyboard` and automatically instantiates the first ViewController and put its view into a new `UIWindow` object.

The backing for storyboard is `ViewController` and for NIB is `View`.
